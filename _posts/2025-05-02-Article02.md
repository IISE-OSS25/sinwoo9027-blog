1. Source-available vs Open Source

What is a “source-available” license?

A source-available license refers to a license under which the source code is made publicly accessible, but with certain restrictions on its use, modification, or redistribution. This differs from open source, which must meet all the criteria defined by the Open Source Definition (OSD) set by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

Examples of Source-Available (but not OSI-approved) Licenses

License

Why it does not comply with OSD

Server Side Public License (SSPL)

Violates OSD #6: Discriminates against certain fields of use, such as SaaS providers

Business Source License (BSL)

Violates OSD #1: Limits use until a future date, delaying open access

Elastic License

Restricts SaaS redistribution and limits modification rights

RStudio License (pre-2023)

Imposes commercial usage restrictions

Common Clauses Violated

OSD #1 (Free Redistribution): Some licenses restrict when and how the software can be shared.

OSD #3 (Derived Works): May place limits on modifications.

OSD #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor): Blocks use in certain commercial settings.

2. OpenRAIL License and OSI Compatibility

What is OpenRAIL?

The Open Responsible AI License (OpenRAIL), created by Hugging Face, is designed to promote the ethical and responsible use of AI models. While it allows access to the models and their reuse, it includes specific restrictions to prevent misuse in areas such as surveillance, deepfake creation, or spreading hate speech.

Purpose of OpenRAIL

OpenRAIL incorporates ethical clauses into an otherwise open license format. For example, it might state that the model cannot be used to intentionally cause harm to individuals or groups. This creates a balance between access and accountability.

Would OSI consider OpenRAIL open source?

It is unlikely that OpenRAIL would be approved by the OSI as an open source license. The inclusion of purpose-based restrictions conflicts with several of the OSD clauses:

OSD #5 and #6: It discriminates based on field of use, such as banning government surveillance.

OSD #7: It may place additional limitations on redistribution and use beyond what the OSD allows.

Summary

Category

Details

Purpose

Encourage ethical use of AI technologies

OSI Approval

No, does not meet full OSD requirements

Main Concern

Conflicts with the principle of unrestricted use and redistribution

Conclusion

Source-available licenses and initiatives like OpenRAIL represent attempts to adapt software licensing to the ethical challenges posed by modern technologies such as AI. However, because of restrictions based on purpose or field of use, they do not fit within the traditional definition of open source as defined by OSI.
